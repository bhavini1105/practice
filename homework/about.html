                       <b> <p>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a
                        seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, 
                        customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including 
                        desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.</p></b>
                       <i> <p>Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items.
                         Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for 
                        digital products, such as digital audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to 
                        the customer over the Internet.</p></i>
